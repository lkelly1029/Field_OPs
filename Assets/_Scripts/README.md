# _Scripts (Vendor / Infrastructure)

This folder contains third-party, generated, or infrastructure-level code
(e.g. Supabase integration).

Rules:
- Do NOT place gameplay, UI, or simulation logic here.
- Do NOT refactor casually.
- Treat as vendor-owned code.
- Files here are protected by guardrails.
